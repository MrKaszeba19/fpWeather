# fpWeather

**fpweather** – a console application displaying weather information for your city using OpenWeatherMap API

Author: Paul Lipkowski

## Installation

- Required: 
    * FreePascal Compiler `fpc` (version 3.0.4 or newer)
    * an OpenWeather API token
- If using Linux, then just compile by executing `compile.sh`
- If using Windows, then compile by executing `compile.bat`
    * The default version of FPC is 3.0.4. If you use the another version of it, then edit the `compile.bat` script and change the setting containing version of FPC (variable `ver`) in order to match your FPC version.

  
## Usage

**So far the program is in development and isn't able to display the weather**
